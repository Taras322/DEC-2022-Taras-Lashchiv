<h1>Simpson family</h1>
<img src="img/The_Simpsons_Simpsons_FamilyPicture.png" alt="Simpson_family">
<p>The Simpsons are a typical family who lives in a fictional Middle American town of Springfield.
  Homer Simpson, the father, works as a safety director at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality.
  He is married to Marge, a stereotypical American housewife, and mother.
  They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist;
  and Maggie, a baby who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier.
  The show continuously resets time so the characters don't age.
  The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in "I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot".
  Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes.
  Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons do not physically
  age and still appear just as they did at the end of the 1980s.
  Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.
  The show includes an array of quirky characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople, and local celebrities.
  The creators originally intended many of these characters to be one-time jokesters or fulfill needed functions in the town.
  A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes.
  According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large, supporting cast from the comedy show Second City Television.</p>

<img src="img/Homer_Simpson.png" alt="Homer_Simpson">
<p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956) is a man from Springfield. He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.
  Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him.
  Although he has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't.
  His favorite color is blue, and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade racer, playing the piano and horse riding.
  His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride the Champion Mechanical Horse".
  Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is often
  incompetent and negligent towards his duties.
  He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak.
  At home, he can often be found sitting on the couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff.
  Homer is also the only son of Abraham Simpson II and Mona Simpson. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him.
  Even though he mutually hates his wife's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and
  agreed to be the minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage.
  As a result of this, Homer is her legal adoptive father.
  Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a Grammy,
  an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many times.</p>

<img src="img/Bart_Simpson.png" alt="Bart_Simpson">
<p>Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born Feburary 23 or April 1, 1980) is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous"
  oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie.
  He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit",
  "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson.
  Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.
  Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series,
  he has discovered a new comet which was named after him[9], and he also has performed in a successful band with Milhouse Van Houten,
  Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.</p>

<h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Lisa_Simpson">Lisa Simpson</a></h2>
<img src="img/Lisa_Simpson_official.png" alt="Lisa_Simpson">
<p>Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9, 1983)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of
  the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series. In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is
  also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary.
  She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age.
  Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement
  of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest
  in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her
  with only a few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already
  a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out at those who she deems
  lower than her or even above her. She has extreme jealousy from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her
  title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things through.</p>
